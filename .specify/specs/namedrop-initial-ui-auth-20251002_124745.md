# Feature Specification: NameDrop Initial UI & Authentication System

## Overview
Prepare the initial structure and UI for NameDrop, an Ad Naming Generator. The initial UI will feature a dark theme with world-class UI/UX design methodologies, complete responsiveness, and a comprehensive login system that stores users in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Google Cloud. The system will include user management capabilities with role-based access control (users and admins) and secure password management via email delivery.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-02
- Q: What should happen when a user account is in different states? → A: Simple binary: active/inactive with email verification required before first login
- Q: How many concurrent users and total users should the system handle? → A: Small scale: < 100 concurrent users, < 1,000 total users
- Q: How should the system handle and communicate errors to users? → A: Specific but safe: "Invalid email format" or "Password too short"
- Q: How should the initial admin account be established? → A: Database seed script creates first admin during deployment
- Q: How should users verify their email addresses? → A: Click link in email to verify, then login normally

-- User roles enum
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('user', 'admin');

-- Password reset tokens
CREATE TABLE password_reset_tokens (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  used_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User sessions (for additional security)
